# Alpha Park Infinite Post Feed Demo

**In this codebase, similar to our codebase for Alpha Park's website, we use the [T3 Stack](./what-is-t3-stack.md) and with tools like ESLint and Prettier**

## What you need to do

Create an infinite post feed that displays products from our database, similar to a Twitter feed.

## Requirements

- Use Prisma's [Pagination](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/pagination#-cons-of-offset-pagination) functionality to fetch the posts incrementally from the database
- Use tRPC's [Infinite query](https://trpc.io/docs/client/react/useInfiniteQuery) to fetch the posts from the backend to the frontend
- You do not need to style the feed, but you can if you want to with TailwindCSS
- You can choose to deploy the website to Vercel, but it's not required

## Submission

- Just create a pull request to this repository with your code

_Happy coding!_
